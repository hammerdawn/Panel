# Changelog
This file is a running track of new features and fixes to each version of the panel released starting with `v0.4.0`.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) guidelines.

## v0.6.0-pre.1
### Added
* Remote routes for daemon to contact in order to allow Daemon to retrieve updated service configuration files on boot. Centralizes services to the panel rather than to each daemon.
* Basic service pack implementation to allow assignment of modpacks or software to a server to pre-install applications and allow users to update.
* Users can now have a username as well as client name assigned to their account.
* Ability to create a node through the CLI using `pterodactyl:node` as well as locations via `pterodactyl:location`.
* New theme (AdminLTE) for front-end with tweaks to backend files to work properly with it.

### Fixed
* Bug causing error logs to be spammed if someone timed out on an ajax based page.
* Fixes edge case where specific server names could cause daemon errors due to an invalid SFTP username being created by the panel.

### Changed
* Admin API and base routes for user management now define the fields that should be passed to repositories rather than passing all fields.
* User model now defines mass assignment fields using `$fillable` rather than `$guarded`.

### Deprecated

## v0.5.6 (Bodacious Boreopterus)
### Added
* Added the following languages: Estonian `et`, Dutch `nl`, Norwegian `nb` (partial), Romanian `ro`, and Russian `ru`. Interested in helping us translate the panel into more languages, or improving existing translations? Contact us on Discord and let us know.
* Added missing `strings.password` to language file for English.
* Allow listing of users from the API by passing either the user ID or their email.

### Fixed
* Fixes bug where assigning a variable a default value (or valid value) of `0` would cause the panel to reject the value thinking it did not exist.
* Addresses potential for crash by limiting total ports that can be assigned per-range to 2000.
* Fixes server names requiring at minimum 4 characters. Name can now be 1 to 200 characters long. :pencil2:
* Fixes bug that would allow adding the owner of a server as a subuser for that same server.
* Fixes bug that would allow creating multiple subusers with the same email address.
* Fixes bug where Sponge servers were improperly tagged as a spigot server in the daemon causing issues when booting or modifying configuration files.
* Use transpiled ES6 -> ES5 filemanager code in browsers.
* Fixes service option name displaying the name of a nwly added variable after the variable is added and until the page is refreshed. (see #208)

### Changed
* Filemanager and EULA checking javascript is now written in pure ES6 code rather than as a blade-syntax template. This allows the use of babel to transpile into ES5 as a minified version.

## v0.5.5 (Bodacious Boreopterus)
### Added
* New API route to return allocations given a server ID. This adds support for a community-driven WHMCS module :rocket: available [here](https://github.com/hammerdawn/Pterodactyl-WHMCS).

### Fixed
* Fixes subuser display when trying to edit an existing subuser.

## v0.5.4 (Bodacious Boreopterus)
### Added
* Changing node configuration values now automatically makes a call to the daemon and updates the configuration there. Changing daemon tokens now does not require any intervention, and takes effect immediately. SSL & Port configurations will still require a daemon reboot.
* New button in file manager that triggers the right click menu to enable support on mobile devices and those who cannot right click (blessed be them).
* Support for filtering users when listing all users on the system.
* Container ID and User ID on the daemon are now shown when viewing a server in the panel.

### Changed
* File uploads now account for a maximum file size that is assigned for the daemon, and gives cleaner errors when that limit is reached.
* File upload limit can now be controlled from the panel.
* Updates regex and default values for some Minecraft services to reflect current technology.

### Fixed
* Fixes potential for generated password to not meet own validation requirements.
* Fixes some regex checking issues with newer versions of Minecraft.

## v0.5.3 (Bodacious Boreopterus)
### Fixed
* Fixed an error that occurred when viewing a node listing when no nodes were created yet due to a mis-declared variable. Also fixes a bug that would have all nodes trying to connect to the daemon using the same secret token on the node listing, causing only the last node to display properly.
* Fixes a bug that displayed the panel version rather than the daemon version when viewing a node.
* Fixes a multiplicator being applied to an overallocation field rather than a storage space field when adding a node.

### Changed
* Added a few new configuration variables for nodes to the default config, as well as a variable that will be used in future versions of the daemon.

## v0.5.2 (Bodacious Boreopterus)
### Fixed
* Time axis on server graphs is corrected to show the minutes rather than the current month.
* Node deletion now works correctly and deletes allocations as well.
* Fixes a bug that would leave orphaned databases on the system if there was an error during creation.
* Fixes an issue that could occur if a UUID contained `#e#` formatting within it when it comes to creating databases.
* Fixed node status display to account for updated daemon security changes.
* Fixes default language being selected as German (defaults to English now).
* Fixes bug preventing the deletion of database servers.

### Changed
* Using `node:<name>` when filtering servers now properly filters the servers by node name, rather than looking for the node ID.
* Using `owner:<email>` when filtering servers now properly filters by the owner's email rather than ID.
* Added some quick help buttons to the admin index page for getting support or checking the documentation.
* Panel now displays `Pterodactyl Panel` as the company name if one is not set.

### Added
* Added basic information about the daemon when viewing a node, including the host OS and version, CPU count, and the daemon version.
* Added version checking for the daemon and panel that alerts admins when daemons or the panel is out of date.
* Added multiplicator support to certain memory and disk fields that allow users to enter `10g` and have it converted to MB automatically.

## v0.5.1 (Bodacious Boreopterus)
### Fixed
* Fixes a bug that allowed a user to bypass 2FA authentication if using the correct username and password for an account.

## v0.5.0 (Bodacious Boreopterus)
After nearly a month in the works, version `v0.5.0` is finally here! ðŸŽ‰

### Added
* Foreign keys are now enabled on all tables that the panel makes use of to prevent accidental data deletion when associated with other tables.

* Support for 'ARK: Survival Evolved' servers through the panel.
* Support for filtering servers within Admin CP to narrow down results by name, email, allocation, or defined fields.
* Setup scripts (user, mail, env) now support argument flags for use in containers and other non-terminal environments.

* Support for creating a new server through the API by passing a user ID rather than an email.
* Passing `?daemon=true` flag to [`/api/servers/:id`](https://pterodactyl.readme.io/v0.5.0/reference#single-server) will return the daemon stats as well as the `daemon_token` if using HTTPS.
* Small check for current node status that shows up to the left of the name when viewing a listing of all nodes.
* Support for creating server without having to assign a node and allocation manually. Simply select the checkbox or pass `auto_deploy=true` to the API to auto-select a node and allocation given a location.
* Support for setting IP Aliases through the panel on the node overview page. Also cleaned up allocation removal.
* Support for renaming files through the panel's file mananger.

### Changed

* **ALL** API routes previously returning paginated result sets, or result sets nested inside a descriptive block (e.g. `servers:`) have been changed to return a single array of all associated items. Please see the [updated documentation](https://pterodactyl.readme.io/v0.5.0/reference) for how this change might effect your API use.
* API route for [`/api/users/:id`](https://pterodactyl.readme.io/v0.5.0/reference#single-user) now includes an array of all servers the user is set as the owner of.
* Prevent clicking server start button until server is completely off, not just stopping.
* Upon successful creation of a node it will redirect to the allocation tab and display a clearer message to add allocations.
* Trying to add a new node if no location exists redirects user to location management page and alerts them to add a location first.
* `Server\AjaxController@postSetConnection` is now `Server\AjaxController@postSetPrimary` and accepts one post parameter of `allocation` rather than a combined `ip:port` value.
